Users need to upload 2 csv files, review.csv and metadata.csv

Column position of the csv files is restricted. Thus, first column of review.csv should refer to product id only. Column name can be modified. Thus, first column of review.csv can be named "Product Id", "ASIN", "Product Number", etc.

Variants:
- small (10 products, ~50 reviews)
- medium (50 products, ~600 reviews)
- large (1k products, ~13k reviews)
- extra large (10k products, 400k reviews)
